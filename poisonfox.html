		<h1>Poison Fox</h1>
		<p>Currently, firefox devtools is: <b id="status"></b></p>
		<p>
			A little application of a known issue (more like "feature") of cyclic objects in the firefox JS console.<br>
			What to do:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the firefox devtools console</li>
				<li>Have lots of fun with your buggy tab!</li>
				<li>Once you're done, close the tab and all will return to normal</li>
			</ol>
			Alternatively, if the devtools detection code is not working, you can just <button onclick="doPoison()">Click Here</button> with the console open.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Firefox already knows about this particular cyclic object issue, but they haven't fixed it, so I thought this would be a cool application of it.<br>
			As of as of 3/12/2020 this works on the latest firefox (regular, developer addition and nightly builds).<br><br>
			
			A cool observation: For most tabs, if this bug is executed all one has to do to "fix" it is close the tab.<br>
			But on the "new tab" page, this will bug the console and then even if the new tab page is closed and then opened again, <br>
			the console stays bugged. IDK why, maybe console instance is cached and so it's staying alive even after the new tab page is closed.<br>

			console.log(Location.prototype); // Actual bug happens here if the devtools console is open.
		}
		
		window.onload = function() {
			if(!isFirefox) {
				body.innerHTML = "<h1>This only works on FireFox!</h1>";
				return;
